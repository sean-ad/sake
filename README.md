#Homebrew Sake
## Recipe and instructions

Sake is rice, yeast, water, and a special mold.  The mold spores are started on a small batch of cooked rice which is then referred to as "koji" or malt-rice.  You can buy pre-made koji at specialty Asian food stores, or make your own with spores from your LHBS (see below).  The rice is added in several additions

Standard ratios are 25 koji : 100 rice : 160 water (any units).  For this 3 gallon batch we need a total of:

* 2.5 lbs koji (about 8 cups)
* 10 lbs rice
* 16 lbs water (about 2 gallons)
* Sake yeast (WLP705 for basic style (Sake #&7) or WLP709 (Sake #9) for a more aromatic style)
 
If making your own koji, the total uncooked rice needed is actually about 13 lbs.

##Yeast Starter (Moto) 
_Total time 2 weeks (but can be trimmed):_
* 2.5 C water (cold helps)
* Yeast nutrient
* Pinch epsom salt
* about 1.5 cups dry rice (about 9 oz), cooked
* about 1/2 C prepared Koji (below) - (Cold helps)
* Sake yeast

**Before Day 1**: Make Koji. Dry, cool or freeze it.  (Add 2 days for this).

**Day 1**: Cook rice.  Mix with cold water and cold Koji and your temp should stabilize around 80F.  Keep at 70 F for two days.  Koji is converting rice starch to sugars.

**Day 3**: If using WLP709, chill to around 50 F.  Aerate liquified rice, pitch yeast, keep at temp for 12 hours or so.

**Days 4-8**: Let warm back to 70 on day 4.  Stir 2x day.

**Day 9**: Stir & return to 50 F if possible (if using WLP709).

**Days 10-14**: Let it rest.  Make more koji if you’re gonna need it for the next step.

##Main Fermentation##
_Total time 28 days (or so)_ :

Add rice & koji in several batches over 3 days to coax yeast to high alcohol levels after koji converts the rice starch.  Let ferment for 3 weeks or so.  Need:

* 8 lbs rice
* 6 C koji (about 2.2 lbs uncooked rice)
* 28.5 C water
* Pinch Epsom salt, or up to 1/2 ounce low alpha hops

**Day 1**:
* 2.5 cups dry rice (about 15oz), cooked
* 1 cup frozen/cool koji
* 2.75 cups cold water
* Pinch salt or hops

The night before, let starter warm to 70 F and stir koji into it, if you have time.  On brew day, cook the rice, add it to the cold water/salt/hops mixture to cool.  When it’s about 85 F combine with the starter in the fermenter.  Stir.

**Day 2**:
* 6c rice (about 36 oz) (8 rice cooker cups)
* 1.5 c koji
* 8.75 C water

As before, add koji, cook rice, mix with cold water, & when cool add to fermenter.  Stir.

**Day 3**:
* 5 lbs rice (about 13.5 cups).  Work in batches if you have to. 
* The rest of the koji (20 oz or about 3.25 cups dry)
* 1 gal + 1 cup water (about 17 cups)

As before, add koji, cook rice, mix with cold water, & when cool add to fermenter.  Stir.  Leave overnight then reduce to 50 F (if using WLP709).

**Days 4-28**:
Stir 1x day for 1 week, then leave it alone for 25 days (at 50 F, if using WLP709, or 70 F if WLP705).  Keep an eye on the SG - when it’s around 1.00 you should separate the rice wine from the lees by siphoning, and pressing the lees in cheesecloth.

Let settle a few weeks in secondary, fining with bentonite or gelatin before bottling. Pasteurize before closing lids or just refrigerate and keep cold.

### Notes

**Sanitation**: Sanitize like when making beer, but no need to go overboard.  The koji and yeast starters can be exposed to the air, just cover loosely with plastic wrap.  I use an airlock for the main fermentation out of habit.

**Rice** should be sushi-grade white rice.  All measurements are dry.  It should be steamed in a rice cooker or stovetop (not boiled).  It should come out firm.  Discard any batches that are mushy.  Some recommend rinsing and soaking first if using a stovetop steamer.  In my rice cooker it comes out too soft that way, so I skip the soak.  In Minnesota you can get a 5 pound bag of Kokuho Rose sushi rice at Cub Foods.

**Yeast**: There are two types of common sake yeast in Japan, #7 and #9.  White Labs WLP705 is fairly easy to get year-round in Minnesota and makes good standard sake, equivalent to #7.  WLP709 is seasonally available and is closer to #9, which is more aromatic and needs a lower fermentation temp.  You can also try a lager yeast.

**Koji** is easy to make using the typical sake homebrew kit at your LHBS.  Directions are on the package.  Cook the rice, let it cool, spread 1/2 TSP of spores on top, and keep around 86 F in a dark, moist place for a day and a half.  A picnic cooler with a couple gallons of hot water in plastic containers works well (change them a couple times).  Then refrigerate, freeze or dry it.
